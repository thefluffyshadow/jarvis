# Neural Network Implementation
_Assignment for CS390L: Cognitive Science & AI_

Specifications as given:
* implements neurons as generic processing elements specified in class 
* receives a vector of input signals, including from itself
* maintains a vector of weights corresponding to those input signals
* normalizes vectors to have a magnitude of 1
* based on the inputs and weights, either generates a single output signal (fires) or does not
* Implements an Instar Activity formula that includes Activation Decay and Interneurode Inputs
* Implements an Instar Learning formula that includes Forgetting and Hebbian learning
* implements a network of fully-connected processing elements
* processes all elements in parallel (time-stepped)
* updates activation, firing status, and weights of each processing element

a neural-network test program that demonstrates the behavior of your neural-net program
* Demonstrates examples of the behavior of grandmother cells
* Demonstrates Instar Activity behavior, including both activation decay and influence of interneurone inputs
* Demonstrates Instar Learning behavior, including both forgetting and Hebbian learning
